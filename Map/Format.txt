The maps are built as follows:

First line contains the file format version, e.g. AStarv10

The second line contains the amount of rows cols in the map

The remaing n rows contain m cols of ascii characthers representing map cells, with the following meaning:

=> . free position
=> * wall (by convention, it can actually be anything but .)
